See "Python Scripting Program Running Haskell, Prolog, MATLAB, and C.pdf"

Script controlling 4 different operations on an image using 4 different programming languages, all drive by python script to run the 4 separate operations on the image.


After working diligently on this project to fix all of my errors mostly coming from the C program and the Python wrapper program, I was able to complete the project. What I learned from day 1 was how to use file inputs in the programming languages of haskell and prolog. This was interesting because I didnt know how to do it in those languages, but I was aware of the argc argv command line input paradigm present in C language. It was also a good refresher to utilize malloc(). The resources I used for this project included the documentation for C, haskell, prolog, python, and the slides presented by Professor Krishna regarding all of the programming languages and how to bring in, manipulate, and paste out files. Finally, the last resource I used was ChatGPT to troubleshoot errors on my command line with compiler errors like gcc and python3 compiler and interpreter. Another thing I used chatgpt for was to help with matlab code to manipulate the image to show them on figures. What I learned was how to combine all the photos into one screen using subplot().
